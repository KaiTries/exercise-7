\maketitle
I forked the github repo so all the code can be found on here: \href{https://github.com/KaiTries/exercise-7}{Github}.
Additionally I documented everything, and also answered the questions in task 3 in the  \href{https://github.com/KaiTries/exercise-7/blob/main/SOLUTION.md}{SOLUTION.md}.\\
I invested way too much time in to the c++ version, so please use this version as it is much much faster and displays the program state a lot nicer. Both an executable for the windows64 and apple Arm64 architecture are available in the \href{https://github.com/KaiTries/exercise-7/tree/main/release}{release folder}. If the binaries are not compatible it is very easy to compile and build yourself, the needed commands are in the SOLUTION.md.
